# Introduction

The project is based on an architechture with one client application \(the webapp\) and a backend \(the API\) communicating together. The webapp asks for or sends information to the backend, who in turn submits this information to the database.

The live and public API documentation can be found (on release) at http://api.132ndvirtualwing.org, with the endpoints starting at http://api.132ndvirtualwing.org/v1/
